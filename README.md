> Arguing on the internet is one of the worlds most ancient and fine arts. But, most of us just haven't found that perfect place to let the people of the world know how wrong they are about all kinds of matters.

## My project - OpFlip
OpFlip is a place where people can come together to not agree with each other and argue irrationally. No place is better for argumantation and making people change their minds on various issues than the internet, and OpFlip is where you shold do this.


### The rules of OpFlip
- Dont be mean. Or at least not TOO mean
- Never give up on your arguments. The others are wrong, you are right. You know this
- Tell your friends about your new favourite site

### Final notes:
- OpFlip is a joke. People are generally not changing their minds due to internet argumantation. The creators of OpFlip are well aware of this and are therefore using this fact as a "fun" theme for the site.
