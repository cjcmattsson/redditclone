> Vader: Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your father. <br />
Luke: He told me enough! He told me you killed him! <br />
Vader: No. I am your father. <br />
Luke: [shocked] No. No! That's not true! That's impossible! <br />
Vader: Search your feelings; you know it to be true! <br />
Luke: NOOOOOOO! NOOOOOOOO!!!

## Assignment:
- Create a memory game with 8-10 pairs
- The cards should be positioned randomly before a new game start
- The game must include a restart button that reorder the cards randomly, using Javascript and not through a page reload
- The game should be programmed in HTML, CSS and Javascript, no libraries or other languages
- Have fun!


## My project
The theme of the game should need no introduction

## The rules of the game
- Put your volume on a REASONABLE level. Not to low, but maybe not to high either.. (If you REALLY hate music, turn your volume off)
- Read the very important text that tells whats at stake when the page is loaded
- Find the 8 pairs before the time runs out! You'll have 45 seconds to do this
- Bonus: Try to do this in as few clicks as possible!
- Tell your friends about your new favourite game
