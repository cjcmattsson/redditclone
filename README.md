> Arguing on the internet is one of the worlds most ancient and fine arts. But, most of us just haven't found that perfect place to let the people of the world know how wrong they are about all kinds of matters.
Well search no further - OpFlip is here!

## Assignment:
- Create a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a> clone
- Users should be able to create and account with email, name, biography & password as well as uppload an avatar
- Users should be able to login and logout
- Users should be able to create posts/links, upvote/downvote links & delete links
- Users should be able to edit uploaded content (profile-info and links)
- Have fun!


## My project - OpFlip
OpFlip is a place where people can come together over not coming together. No place is better for argumantation and making people change their minds on various issues than the internet, and OpFlip is the place to do this.


### The rules of OpFlip
- Dont be mean. Or at least not TOO mean
- Never give up on your arguments. They are wrong, you are right. You know this
- Tell your friends about your new favourite site

### Final notes:
- OpFlip is a joke. People are generally not changing their minds due to internet argumantation. The creators of OpFlip are well aware of this and are therefore using this fact as a "fun" theme for the site.
